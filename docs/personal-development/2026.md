## Professional Devlopment

### Gain LLM and Generative AI Comfort
These tools are not going away any time soon, and the need to add the ability to manage and use them to the resume is becoming paramount. 

### Kubernetes Knowledge

This year, an interest to expand on for the resume is to learn more containerization, specifically Kubernetes and its tech stack. To do this
I will complete the Udemy course:

- Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests

Following this course completion, the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam will be passed for certification.

### .NET Language and Structure 

It seems that over the coming year it will be imperative to gain proficiency in both .NET programming languages
(C#, F#, etc.) and the build structure for work. This will require conistent outside typical work hours work to maintain standards, so time
needs to be set aside to iterate on these skills with side projects and other various ways to stay up to date.

A fun way to do this would be to continue to iterate on game ideas within the MonoGame engine, which uses pure
.NET

### Continue to Work on Side Projects

By the end of 2026 the:

- resume site will be feature complete with only new experiences being added
- NBA stat application will have a working UI and fully developed backend
- Arbitrage dashboard with Drew will be in a usable condition for at least two prediction markets.
